# Wellington

A VIM environment.

Clone the project into your `~/.vim` directory.

`git clone git@github.com:brianp/wellington.git ~/.vim/ -r`

Then symlink the `~/vimrc/` file in your home directory.
`ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc/ ~/.vimrc`

## Colours
The default is an older (Version: 3.1) of the [lucius](https://github.com/jonathanfilip/vim-lucius) colour scheme.
Lucius has been updated past version 3.1 but I like this version more. The colour scheme is set in `vimrc` to easily change the defaults.

## Custom Mappings

## Special Thanks
To Carl Lerche and Yehuda Katz for the [janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) bundle.
It is what helped me learn and make VIM my main editor and eventually inspired me to make this project.
